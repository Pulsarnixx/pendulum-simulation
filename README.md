# ðŸŒŸ Pendulum Simulation

The project for an engineering thesis at the Wroclaw University of Technology. 
For this purpose, I wrote a basic graphics engine based on GLFW and OpenGL and a pendulum motion simulation application based on it.

## ðŸ“‹ Requirements

The code was written with modern Debian/Ubuntu systems in mind.

Before running the project, make sure you have the following tools and packages installed:
